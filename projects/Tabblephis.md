summary: A battleship like game made for a final project for EE 160.
---

This project was made similarly to the real game Battleship except you are versus a computer. As a submarine commander piloting
your area, your task is to find and locate as many phis(ships) you can with your torpedos in a given 6 x 15 cell area. There are
a total of 6 phis at varying sizes so hitting all of the phis makes nets you a total of 20 maximum points waiting to be collected.

We were assigned with numerous kinds of modules and followed a five step design process. Through many different experiments and
coding debugs, my group and I were able to complete the projects with all drivers working as expected. This project has taught me 
about time management and how to collaborate well with others to complete a given task.
