### Coronavirus Who?

The whole coronavirus also known as COVID-19 is a disease that has slowly started to rise during the ending of December and in the past few months has greatly increased in number of cases. COVID-19 originates in Wuhan, China but has spread worldwide and has become a pandemic. Now most places of the world including Europe, US, and many other areas have been affected by this. This respiratory disease is also airborne meaning it is easily able to spread amongst others, especially in crowded places. This has led to many new enforced laws and the requiring of social distancing in order to try and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

### My Thoughts on Coronavirus

Initially when I heard about this new virus that is becoming more widespread, I didn't think of it much as the cases didn't seem that bad and I initially thought it seemed contained in China. But as time started rolling and the spring break was around the corner, the number of cases sky-rocketed and slowly started to spread to other areas besides China. I still didn't panick but it seems like the effect started to take place as I work at Walmart and it has become way more busier than it normally is. More people started to panic and all I hear coming home from school at the time would be my dad talking to me about the coronavirus. Now I started to feel like coronavirus aint a joke now and its serious business. I got more scared with the fact that I was going to Washington during spring break, and that state was one of the first cases of coronavirus confirmed in the US. I didn't want it cancelling vacation to Washington and thankfully it wasn't but it still affected my trip as I barely got to go out due to many places closed down in fear of the coronavirus. 

### Current Feelings on Coronavirus

The way it has affected my life is still unreal to me. School is now changing to online classes, which has its positives and negatives. I love the fact that I don't have to spend so much time commuting to school, but online classes feels like I learn much less than I normally would compared to sitting in a class and really trying to absorb the material, it just feels much different style. The whole social distancing I don't like as I love to spent time with friends and family but it raises the risks of being exposed to COVID-19. After coming back from my trip to Washington, I had to self quarantine for 2-weeks on behave of my work. 

### Conclusion

Overall, the coronavirus has greatly affected my life both in and out of school. I am kind of sad that work will continue to be extremely busy and stressful and strange learning academic we are forced to go through due to the virus, but there is some positives as well such as being able to stay home, get proper sleep, and not worrying about commuting to school which took up a lot of my time. In the end I hope everyone as an individual in this society can come together during these hard times in order to flatten the curve and stop the coronavirus.
