### Project: Gaming Station

### Overview
The Problem: With so many UH students on campus, especially here in ICS 314, there are many students that love to play video games. But there is not a lot of potions to go out and find people that also play the same games as you. Not being to play games with someone can make the experience of video games less fun overall.

The Solution: The Gaming Station allows for UH students to create there own profiles of all their favorite current games they play. It may also include there ranks in the game if specified for other students that share the same interest in to join in and game on. With these profiles shown in an organized place moderated by the admins, it allows for many students to freely join others and get better gaming experiences.

### Approach
There will be two types of login, admins and UH students. 
From this students are able to register there own profiles to includes many things such as what kinds of games they play, there different ranks amongst the games, how active they are in the game, and what they want are looking for specifically such as a group of people vs just a partner to play games with. They will also include a way to contact each other such as gamertags or discord ID's in order for each student to easily reach there potential gaming friend.
For the admins, they are able to moderate what is allowed onto each students profiles and remove any inappropriate content from the respective profile if needed.
When searching there will be a way to filter out by which game interest you want to see and community groups. 

### Mockup Page Ideas

* Landing page
* Student home page
* Admin home page
* Search page with optional search filters
* Community Page

### Use Case Ideas

* User goes into a landing page in order to log into the system, gets into the home page then is able to setup there profile. From here they are able to search for other profiles and communities within.
* Admin goes into a landing page in order to log into the system, get in into the home page and is able to moderate the actions by the students.

### Beyond the Basics
* Lets users rate each other based on performance, activity, etc.
* Higher rating students featured more 
* Less chance to encounter lower rated students
* Easily exchange discord ID's and other ways of contacting them via game.
