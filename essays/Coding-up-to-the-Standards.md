### Standard Life

Life is full of standards and basically everything revolve around standards of a certain subject. Whether it be trying to get
an A+ in your ICS 314 class or even applying and getting into your dream job, there is some kind of standard guidelines we must
follow and go through in order to achieve them. These guidelines are normally not too easily achievable and require some 
hardwork. Personally I had to experience this with the start of my college life. Before I was in college, I found high school
to be a walk in the park when it came to getting good grades(This could be because of the school I went to but thats a topic
for a later day). For the most part, the standard of getting good grades at the time were not too difficult especially with the
numerous amounts of extra credit that was offered for such simple tasks. But this all changed as soon as I started to go to
college. It was very rare to see any signs of extra credit professors came to offer, what a shocker. But in all seriousness,
the standards of achieving the same A+ for some classes became more difficult than I could ever imagine. The difference in
how lectures are run and the increase in independence on my own educations made achieving that A+ look more and more unreachable.
This new standard is something I had to adapt to in order to start seeing that success again throughout my college life.

### Standards Into Coding Now Great...

Working on my third year of my college life, I have taken a decent amount of coding classes working in different kinds of
programming languages. From C++ to Javascript, both function in completely different ways but the one similarity that all
programming languages have are that they have some sort of coding standard. Its just like life, there is some kind of standard
for anything that exist. I propose there should be some internet rule called rule 35 that states that if something exists in life,
there shall be standards of it. Anyways, these coding standards work similar between the two programming languages and it seems
more like a grammar convention. Like how in when you format an essay you space out the headings from the actual essay part to
make it look more spaced and readable, I try to do something similar when it comes to coding. Such as using console.log statements
inorder to print my results. I try to space it out from the actual function so I know they are seperate from each other. Another
personal coding standard for me is using comments. This was a huge aspect we needed in my EE 160 and 260 classes so it most
likely passed over to me when it comes to Javascript. When working with assignments that use multiple functions or aspects,
I try to comment through each so if I do plan to take a look at it again, It is easily documented and will can be followed
through with no troubles. This also helps with errors as if I plan to take a break, comments help show my footsteps of where
I was at or the numerous amount of attempts I tried at tackling a certain problem.

### ESLint and the Fun

Its been about a month working with Javascript and recently just learned how to use IntelliJ and incredibly powerful software
development environment. After going through the initally painful installations and specific configurations to finally be able
to work ESLint into IntelliJ and start programming, I would have to rate this a 5/10. This was mainly due to the numerous setting
I had to change and at one point was struggling to get anything workign when I tried to program. But after fixing all these
issues via venting at a previous ICS 314 student who happened to point out that I forgot a . in .eslintrc(Note
to self, read each step carefully), I really started to like how IntelliJ works and would rate it an 8/10 now. I dont think the
green check mark is all that helpful as the only thing it does to me is give me a sanity check. Most of the time, when I don't
get a green checkmark its because I may have forgot to enable ESLint then seeing the checkmark just tells me I wasn't going crazy.
A better way to put it is that the green checkmark is more of a placebo than an actual help, but hey in life sometimes all we
ever need as a placebo effect to make us feel better.
