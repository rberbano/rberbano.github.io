### Ethics
There are various definitions for the term "ethics." When it comes to ethics, I believe that ethics is the morals and values an individual has for themselves and for their job. As for software engineering, ethics, to me are what you fel is best for your program, like how to discipline and continue to promote a professional product at the same time. 

### Privacy is the Best Policy
Privacy is one of the most important ethics to have in software engineering. When it comes software, it is important that users have their personal data protected and be able to have to choose whether or not they want to store it on the website or not. For example, when checking out of an online store, an individual has the right to save their information or not to save their information. It is important that personal information is protected. If in any case there are possibilities that data is going to be shared, the users should be told, like in the terms and conditions pages or before they begin the software. Privacy is the best way consumers will be able to trust not only the software, but also the software engineers.

### Ethics as a Whole
In my opinion, it is important to follow the ethics of privacy because software engineers should be able to gain the trust of their customers. Users are trusting the makers of software to have access to their personal data, which means the creators need to protect it at all costs. There have been a lot of data breaches from big companies, which may lead to personal information leaks. This is where privacy is the most important. Any data sharing of any kind should not be allowed for profit or anything in that area.
