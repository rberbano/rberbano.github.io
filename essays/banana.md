## Banana Pancakes
I remember the day I bought unripe, green bananas in the store. There was so many to choose from, yet I chose the green one because I knew eventually it would ripen. As I got home that day, I placed the bananas into the fruit basket and waited days until it ripened. Weeks passed. There my mom was, over the trash can, about to throw away the bananas that I forgot about! “Mom! Wait! Don’t throw away the bananas,” I said. She asked, “why? They’re going bad.” But it wasn’t. It was still useable. It may not look the best, but it can turn into something amazing like banana pancakes. 

## Design Patterns
Bananas come in all shapes in sizes, some are wide, and some are short. As bananas are placed into the fruit bowl, we know that we have all the time in the world to eat a banana, but, of course, waiting too long has its consequences. A lot of time passes by when we are programming and during this time, we may come across the worst errors we need to solve. We refuse to eat the rotten part of the banana, like how a programmer refuses to look at their own code once the errors get too difficult to fix. If one is rotten, just open up another one. 

## Avoiding Conflicts
Turning my almost rotten bananas into banana pancakes teaches me something about design patterns. There are so many different design patterns, some people may not like the ones you like, just like how my mom did not like the bananas I used for my pancakes. Learning about various design patterns and figuring out how to use them may be stressful and lead to conflicts, but in the end, if you think outside the box, you will find the best solution. Why do people slice bananas when we can just rip them? Just like design patterns, we can take the extra step to achieve our goals, like how people take extra steps to properly slice their bananas. No matter how mushy the banana is, how disgusting the code errors look, I will be sure to look at the bright side and make the positive batch of banana pancakes.
