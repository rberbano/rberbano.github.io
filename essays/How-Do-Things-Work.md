### The Start of a New Passion

Growing up, my greatest interest in life was playing video games. I love everything about them. There fun, memorable, and exhilarating,
especially when you finally beat the last boss of the game. As I got older, I became more refined in my gaming skills and a sudden interest
of learning about the different game mechanics in a variety of games. Whether it be staying up all night in order to find a way to skip a key 
cutscenes to trigger a boss fight or even finding out how to exploit the game into giving you items that shouldnt even be physically 
possible, they were all so amazing to see.

### Creativity Of Engineering

Being able to really look deep into something to see how it works has always amazed me especially when you are able to get so really cool results 
such as the ones listed above. As I finally took a step into high school, Youtube become one of the things I became addicted to, for the 
better or for the worst. But as I continued to browse it, many different creation ideas have always sparked my interest and then all of a 
sudden I am dwelling upon the creation of a real life light saber or even a microwave that only works via screaming into it. The whole
engineering design process amazes me with the different creativity you can achieve with it.

### Software to Electrical

Although I am an EE major, this doesnt mean software engineering is completely useless to me as I am able to integrate the design process 
used in software engineering the way I can for electrical engineering. Through software engineering I hope to be able refine my programming and
coding skills especially as programming is becoming more and more common in many different engineering fields as a whole. In the future I hope
to one day be able to design and create my own software/application related to video games to pay homage to my greatest interst in life.
